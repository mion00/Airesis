      title: "The first social network for E-Democracy in the world"
      description: "A tool of direct democracy born to decide and act collectively on proposals and ideas generated anywhere for any theme."
      paragraph_1:
        title: "The Social Network for E-Democracy"
        content_html: |
          <p>Airesis is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software platform</a>, built
          by a team of Italian developers and contributors, to enable communities and groups to organize themselves in a productive manner according to the principles
          of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy" target="_blank">direct democracy</a> and participation.</p>

          <p>To achieve this goal, the application has been designed as a multifunctional system, which integrates all the tools that can
          help the development of a community, in particular "social" and deliberative tools.</p>

          <p>Among <strong>social tools</strong>, Airesis offers blogs and a system of promotion of events and meetings with adjoining scheduling.
          Among <strong>deliberative tools</strong> it includes areas for the collection and deliberation of proposals and initiatives,
          and a voting system aimed to the election of candidates. The platform also allows you to create groups with access regulations policies and customizable permissions.
          Since the goal of Airesis is to stimulate participation, great attention has been spent in order to maximize the intuitiveness of the whole platform.
          The development philosophy is focused on continuous improvement, a kind of evolutionary process based on users feedback.
          The development team is available to meet the needs of the communities which want to use the software according to the spirit of direct democracy.</p>
      paragraph_3:
        title: "Principles and core values"
        content_html: |
          <p>Airesis is an open source decision-making tool for e-democracy,
          strongly oriented to problem-solving and designed to maximize the immense evolutionary power
          of <a heref="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence" target="_blank">collective intelligence</a>.</p>
          <p>Entirely developed by volunteers according to non-profit principles, Airesis was created to take faster, informed, shared and participated decisions.<br/>
          It is based on the following principles:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Participation</strong> <br/>
          Involving citizens means having more energy and points of view available.
          Only through direct participation it is possible to investigate the problems and understand what people really want. Participation is the essence of democratic decisions.
          </li>

          <li><strong>Transparency and Security</strong><br/>
          Without transparency, rules can be easily circumvented and democracy can quickly degenerate.
          Transparency also means openness, ability to receive: for this reasons Airesis also allows unregistered users to view the contents of the site.
          The source code of the software is also "transparent", being it entirely open source.</li>

          <li><strong>Constructive dialogue</strong><br/>
          No one owns all the right answers. Using appropriate tools, elaborating ideas proposed by many people can be more productive than doing it yourself.</li>

          <li><strong>Equal opportunities</strong><br/>
          To be intended as how effective equality, in terms of offered possibilities, can be pursued by the system.
          </li>

          <li><strong>Flexibility</strong><br/>
          Each group ha its own needs, each proposal is different from the others, each user has its own needs.</li>

      paragraph_7:
        title: "Proposal and debate tool"
        content_html: |
          <p>The core of the software is focused on the <strong>deliberative tool</strong> which allows you to participate in the drafting of a proposal, to set a common goal,
          to contribute to the search for alternative solutions and to bring to the vote the result of this work so that the proposal can receive the most
          possible consensus and the best and the most shared solution can emerge.</p>
          <p>The process involves 3 steps:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The author creates the proposal</strong> following a wizard, after wich the system publishes the text in the section <strong>"In debate"</strong>.
            During this period the proposal can be modified by the editors on the basis of given evaluations and contributions added by other users.</li>
            <li>When the <strong>debate quorum is reached</strong> the proposal goes to the section <strong>"Voting"</strong> during this time
            the text of the proposal cannot be changed, the editor chooses a <strong>vote event</strong> (voting period)
            among those already planned or can create a new one using the calendar.<br>
            All eligible users (according to the rules established by the group) can <strong>vote</strong> during the defined period.</li>
            <li><strong>At the end of the vote</strong> the system calculates the <strong>results</strong> and places the proposal in the <strong>"Voted"</strong> section.</li>
            <li>If however the <strong>debate quorum is not reached</strong>, the proposal go to the <strong>"Abandoned"</strong> section, where it can be <strong>put back in debate</strong> to start again a new life cycle.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Particularly interesting is the adoption of a <strong>discussion area</strong> for each published proposal that allows the proposal itself to be modified by the editors (like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki" target="blank">wiki</a>)
          according to the consensus obtained by individual contributions.
          The discussion area is two-levels indented, the first designed to collect contributions, the second personal considerations on the latter.
          The first level implements a mechanism to increment the maturity of the proposal <strong>incorporating in it the most appreciated contributions</strong>.</p>
          <p>The <strong>debate quorum</strong>, necessary to promote a proposal to the voting phase, is composed of three different parameters:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Participants</strong>: number of people who participate in the debate;
            </li>
            <li><strong>Discussion time</strong>: period of time in which the proposal remains in the debate phase (starting from its submission);
            </li>
            <li><strong>Maturity</strong>: percentage of participants who claim that the proposal is ready to be voted;
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The evaluation of "<strong>maturity</strong>" of a proposal is a formal act of the members of the community
          (done during the discussion period), through which they express the <strong>suitability</strong> of the text of the proposal for <strong>the following voting phase</strong>.</p>
          <p>There are <strong>different types of quorum</strong>: Depending on the complexity of the topic, the parameters (participation, time and maturity) vary.
          For the proposals inside the Open Space quorums are defined by the system administrator, while the <strong>quorum of the proposals published inside groups can be freely modified by the groups administrators</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>The proposals are <strong>organized</strong>, <strong>sorted</strong> and <strong>searchable</strong> in different ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>depending on their <strong>status</strong> ("In debate," "Voting", "Voted", "Abandoned")</li>
            <li>according to pre-defined <strong>categories</strong> ("Work", "Health", "Education", etc.)</li>
            <li>depending on the <strong>type</strong> of proposal: standard, regulation, estimate, statement, technical decision, etc ...</li>
            <li>using <strong>free tags</strong> which can be entered in the text of the proposal.</li>
          </ul>
      paragraph_8:
        title: "Schulze voting method and Direct Democracy"
        content_html: |
          <p>When the period of time assigned for the debate ends and a sufficient number of people agree on the maturity of the proposal (these conditions vary according to the quorum of debate), the proposal go to the <strong>voting phase</strong>.</p>
          <p>At this point the proposal is <strong>frozen</strong> and the editor have to <strong>choose a time frame</strong> in which the group will be able to vote the proposal.
          The 'voting' event is recorded on the group calendar and is <strong>notified</strong> to all members of the group.</p>
          <p>At the time of vote a new notification is sent in which it is displayed the proposal to be voted and the page in which the vote occurs. At this point each participant, after having read the proposal and the list of possible solutions, can submit his preference <strong>ordering</strong> these solutions from the most liked to the least and thereby allowing the processing of the <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metodo_Schulze" target="blank">Schulze Method</a> to find out the solution preferrred by the group.</p>
          <p>At the end of the vote the proposal go to the <strong>"voted"</strong> status, where it is possible to review the result of the vote at any time.</p>
      paragraph_9:
        title: "Promotion of shared proposals and Participatory Democracy"
        content_html: |
          <p>Airesis was developed to promote the sharing of ideas and opinions within the community. To achieve this, the platform offers different tools:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the <strong>proposal is public by default</strong>
            </li>
            <li>publication of proposals on <strong>social networks</strong>, in the Open Space of Airesis or on external blogs and forums;
            </li>
            <li>the <strong>personal blog</strong> where community members can present themselfes and post info and announcement in the news of the groups they are members of, in addition to share ideas/opinions;
            </li>
            <li>the possibility of organizing <strong>meetings</strong> for the members of the community;
            </li>
            <li>the possibility to <strong>mark interesting events</strong> on a shared calendar;
            </li>
            <li>the presence of a <strong>discussion board</strong> in each proposal, in which to add contributions that editors will be able to integrate in the text of the proposal, according to the evaluations received;
            </li>
            <li>reputation system that rewards participation, constructive and clarity, encouraging problem solving
            </li>
            <li>the opportunity to invite their contacts to join the discussion
            </li>
            <li>the opportunity to apply to become co-editors of a proposal;</li>
            <li>the resolution on the proposals through the vote of the certified members.
            </li>
          </ul>
      paragraph_10:
        title: "Temporarary anonymity, secret ballot and auditable voting"
        content_html: |
          <p>One of the peculiarities of Airesis is that <strong>groups can choose if the proposals debate will be anonymous or not</strong>.</p>

          <p>If anonymity is enabled, authors and commentators of the proposals are indicated by means of a pseudonym.
          This feature allows you to evaluate the proposals, criticisms and suggestions according on their content only, impartially,
          without the "name" of the authors and the dynamics of interpersonal liking/disliking influence the debate.
          </p>

          <p>In any case , at the end of the debate , and after the vote , the participants will be displayed with their real names so that it will be possible to verify the interventions of each of them.</p>

          <p>This option is also applicable to the voting stage, so it’s possible to choose if this will take place by open or secret ballot.
             Important, especially in the case of a secret ballot, is the ability to verify the registration of his vote and the absence of fraud.
             This is possible through the system of auditable voting implemented by Airesis .

      paragraph1:
        title: "Destination: direct democracy"
        content_html: |
          <p>Airesis was born from the fusion of two projects launched over two years ago as a result of the need to be able to use a
           software platform that could integrate the main features of social networks, event management and mass decision making system.</p>
          <p>In March, 2012, during the meeting "Cittadini a cinque stelle" (Five Stars Citizen) organized in Rimini, Alessandro Rodi
           with its Airesis project came to know Nicola Giulietti and the Agora 2.0 project: on one side, a good software,
           on the other an excellent analysis of the features that a portal for direct democracy should have had.</p>
          <p>Following this meeting it was decided to collaborate in the development of a common open source application so that it could
           implement the functions identified by the Agora 2.0 group in more than a year long work.</p>
          <p>The mission was (and still is) ambitious, but we know that it is possible to be achieved with the right tools, step by step.</p>
          <p>Thanks to our determination what initially looked like a dream of freedom, found the support of many people and the help of programmers,
           analysts, mathematicians, graphic designers and responsible citizens.</p>
          <p>Currently software releases are published on a monthly or bi-monthly basis to meet the demands and needs of users,
           in order to apply a process of continuous improvement.</p>

          <p>
           The volunteers working on this project spend a considerable amount of time in order to bring a useful software for our communities.
           However, volunteering and hard work alone are not sufficient: money is needed to mantain a server installation publicly available, to keep the software updated and experiment with the new features and improvements we are developing. In addition to this, paid work is required for server maintenance and user help desk.
